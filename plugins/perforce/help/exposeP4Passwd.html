    <b>Expose P4PASSWD in environment</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    When this box is checked Hudson/Jenkins will add the P4PASSWD
    environment value to the process environment. This can
    help scripts that need to perform Perforce command operations
    succeed.

  <p>
    <b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp;This is a serious security risk if environment values
    are printed in log files and you should consider alternative ways for
    providing the credentials to command line tools that need them.
