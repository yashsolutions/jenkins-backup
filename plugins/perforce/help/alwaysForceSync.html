    <b>Always Force Sync</b>: allows you to tell this plugin to do a 'p4 sync -f //...' which
    will make sure to pull down ALL files to the workspace, regardless if they have been sync'd
    before.  Use this to get around problems where the Perforce workspace has become out of sync with
    the Perforce server, such as when using a Matrix Build Configuration.  For most users, you should 
    never need to worry about this.
  </p>
  <p><b>Important Note:</b> It is highly recommended that you enable this or the 'Clean Workspace Before 
    Each Build' option when using a Matrix or Multiconfiguration build. Failing to do so could cause
    child builds to not be synced properly.
