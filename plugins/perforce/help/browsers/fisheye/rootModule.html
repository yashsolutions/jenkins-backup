<div>
  Specify the root module of this Project in FishEye. Sometimes the FishEye repository is set up so the root doesn't correspond to the root of the perforce server. This option trims the real root location off the file urls so they resolve correctly in FishEye.
  (Example: <tt>depot/project</tt>)
