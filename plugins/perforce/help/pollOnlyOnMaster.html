    <b>Poll Only on Master</b>: enabling this setting will cause the perforce plugin to only ever poll using the master.
By default, the plugin will attempt to use any active nodes that the job is configured to use. In the case of volatile, on-demand environments, 
greater stability may be acheived by enabling this option. Only enable this option if the perforce configuration in the job is known to work on the master.
