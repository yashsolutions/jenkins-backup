    <b>Restore Changed/Deleted files</b>: This option will scan for any tracked files that have been forcefully changed or removed by some other process (build scripts, compilers, engineers, etc) and force sync them from the repository.
  </p>
  <p>This option takes a bit more time to run than a usual quick clean, so one should avoid making systematic changes to synced code so this option isn't needed.</p>
