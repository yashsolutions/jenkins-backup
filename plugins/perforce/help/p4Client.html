    <b>Workspace (client)</b>: Workspace or Clientspec (oldskewl) of the project. If the workspace
    specified does not exist, Hudson/Jenkins will create it. Parameter substitutions can be used, such as ${JOB_NAME} and any other parameters defined for the job.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important Note</b>: Hudson/Jenkins will likely change the root and host of this workspace to fit Hudson/Jenkins's
    installation.  That means Hudson/Jenkins also automatically creates a workspace for each slave on every
    project.  The hash code of the slave name is appended to the end of the given workspace name to ensure
    that all workspaces are unique and don't collide across machines. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important Note</b>: Each job needs to use it's own unique workspace. Perforce keeps track of what
    files are synced into each workspace, so reusing a workspace could result in files not being properly
    synced down before a build runs. Additionally, if a workspace is used in multiple jobs, the possibility
    exists that Hudson/Jenkins may change the workspace spec while another job that uses it is syncing or polling. This
    will result in odd behavior that's difficult to debug. Only reuse a client workspace if you absolutely 
    know what you are doing!<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important Note</b>: When Hudson/Jenkins creates a workspace, the workspace will contain only one
    view.  This view maps the Depot Path to the root of the Hudson/Jenkins job's workspace directory.  If Hudson/Jenkins
    uses an existing workspace that has only one view, it automatically changes the view in a similar
    way.  This behavior can be disabled by the option, "Let Hudson/Jenkins Manage Workspace View.  This will
    allow you to retrieve more than one depot into the workspace of a given job by providing your own
    list of views.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Important Note</b>: If the client doesn't exist, it is created, but the perforce plugin will not delete the client if it's no longer being used. Likewise, the plugin will not delete the workspace if the client name is changed. In this instance, you may need to wipe the workspace after changing the client name.
