	The Perforce Charset Options are used by perforce when translating different character sets on different platforms. Most users will not have to worry about this. See <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/cmdref/env.P4COMMANDCHARSET.html">P4COMMANDCHARSET</a> and <a href="http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/cmdref/env.P4CHARSET.html">P4CHARSET</a> in the perforce documentation.
