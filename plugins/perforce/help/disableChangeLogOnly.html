    <b>Disable ChangeLog Only</b>: allows you to tell this plugin to not retrieve changelog information
    before the build begins. This may be useful if you have a large amount of changelog information that you do not want Jenkins to store.
  </p>
<p>This option can also be controlled at build time by creating a boolean parameter on the build called "P4DISABLECHANGELOG".</p>
